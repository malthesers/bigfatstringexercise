# üßµ Stringulator

Made as part of KEA's multimedia design, during third semester front-end development course.

Play around with the world-renowned and infamous stringulator [right here](https://malthesers.github.io/stringulator/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Current mechanisms

### Capitalator...
...makes everything lowercase but capitalises the first letter.

### Forenamator...
...leaves only everything before the first space.

### Forelengthiator...
...tells you the amount of characters in whatever's before the first space.

### Middlizer...
...gives you whatever's inbetween the very first and very last space.

### Extensionator...
...informs you of the REAL meaning of the input's file extension, but only jpg and png.

### Asteriskifier...
...shows you what you would have typed if you decided to type the same thing only with asterisks for whatever reason you might do that.

### caPitalator...
...makes the third character uppercase, so do put a letter or face the consequences.

### Ca-Pi-Ta-La-Tor...
...takes your input and capitalises anything following a hyphen, meaning the name of this mechanism probably should have been ca-Pi-Ta-La-Tor instead, however this error will forever be a remnant within this GitHub repo.
